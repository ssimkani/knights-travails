# Knights Travails

## Overview

This project involves a method called 'knight_moves' which takes two coordinates on an 8x8 chessboard and outputs the shortest path that a knight can move between them. The search algorithm used for determining the shortest path is a breadth first search (BFS). This program was created using Ruby as part of the [Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## What I learned

- How to use hashes to create a graph
- How to utilize BFS on a graph data structure to find the shortest path
